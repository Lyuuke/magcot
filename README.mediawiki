'''MAGCOT''' (homophonous with ''maggot'', short for '''Minecraft Auxiliary GUI Component Orientation Tool''') is a Python-based tool used to annotate, describe, and visualize the layouts of Minecraft GUIs, typically in modding.
MAGCOT is dedicated to the last part of the GUI design workflow at artistsâ€™ side, where artists must transcribe the coordinates and sizes of all the GUI elements, and hand over these data to programmers.
